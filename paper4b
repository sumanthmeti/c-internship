Q3. Find the minimum distance between two numbers.
// C++ program to Find the minimum 
// distance between two numbers 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 

int minDist(int arr[], int n, int x, int y) 
{ 
	int i, j; 
	int min_dist = INT_MAX; 
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) 
	{ 
		for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) 
		{ 
			if( (x == arr[i] && y == arr[j] || 
				y == arr[i] && x == arr[j]) && 
				min_dist > abs(i-j)) 
			{ 
				min_dist = abs(i-j); 
			} 
		} 
	} 
	return min_dist; 
} 

/* Driver code */
int main() 
{ 
	int arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 8, 3}; 
	int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
	int x = 3; 
	int y = 6; 

	cout << "Minimum distance between " << x << 
					" and " << y << " is " << 
					minDist(arr, n, x, y) << endl; 
} 


OUTPUT:-Minimum distance between 3 and 6 is 4
